### Instructions

Here's how to contribute translations!

1. Navigate to this repository, making sure that you are viewing the main version of the repository: "HappyShield/happyshield.github.io" 

To translate (or edit an existing translation):

#### If the translation file already exists:

1. Navigate to the relevant file in this repository.
2. Click "Edit this File"
3. Type any changes you would like to make to the text in the file. 
4. Add a description explaining the changes you have made.
5. Commit the changes ("Propose File Change")

You can see this process explained nicely here! https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/#commit

#### If the translation file does not yet exist:

1. Navigate to the English version of the file (for example: `Instructions/HandCreasing/handCreasing_EN.md`) which you will be translating into another language. 
2. Click the edit button.
3. Select all of the text in the file and copy it.
4. Close the file. You should have made no changes, so no commit is necessary. 
5. Navigate to the folder where the file should exist.
6. Click create new file, and choose the appropriate name: `Instructions/HandCreasing/handCreasing_TR.md` for "Hand Creasing" instructions in Turkish (TR), for example.
7. Paste.
8. Edit this text, replacing English with your translated text.
7. If you want to save your progress at any point, commit the changes, and provide a description of the changed made since the previous commit.  

When you are ready for your work to be incorporated into the main repository:

1. Click Create Pull Request
2. Add any helpful description along with your Pull Request to explain to others what you have added or changed to the text.
3. Submit your Pull Request. 

Auri (or whoever is managing the repository!) will review and approve the pull request, and then merge these into the main repository, where they should be rendered on the live website within 3-5 minutes. : )
